  "long_description": "QAOA is a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization. It alternates between a problem Hamiltonian (phase separator) and a mixing Hamiltonian. This circuit implements p=1 QAOA for the MaxCut problem on a 4-node cycle graph (edges: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-0) with \u03b3=0.5 (phase) and \u03b2=0.3 (mixing). The parameters should be classically optimized to maximize the expected cut value.",
